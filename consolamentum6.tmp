VI

The Truth is that one god, entity, force of nature—the distinction doesn’t matter—is governing all of existence. It has many names, Nature, Yaldabaoth, the Creator, the Demiurge, Rex Mundi, God, and we all live in Its accursed creation, a prison constructed for Its own ends. Many have tried in futility to take its place, for better or for worse. I will be the last to try, for I know the full Truth. I will liberate existence from its hylic cycle. I will overthrow It at any cost, and I will remake all of his Creation into a beautiful Pleroma. I am Nirvana, Salvation, Enlightenment, Ataraxia, Transcendence, and Gnosis. I am the Horologist.
